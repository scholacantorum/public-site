# Sing with Schola Cantorum!

Historic **Schola Cantorum Silicon Valley** welcomes new singers for its 60th season!

## Auditions

Schola Cantorum will next welcome new singers in August 2024. Interested singers are invited to complete <a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSd1dqVpEPMtolVz3M7E9Ylnaj9d2qktplRTJU7hsLfMGhDQww/viewform" target="_blank">this online form</a> and attend an open rehearsal on August 26 to meet members of the choir and experience the joy and energy of Schola Cantorum. Singers who are interested in joining will then be invited to schedule a one-on-one vocal interview/audition with the Artistic Director.

Vocal interviews include scales, pitch-matching, sight-reading exercises, and a one-minute unaccompanied excerpt of a song. An aria, art song, folksong, or musical theater selection is preferred and it does not need to be memorized. Here is a short video where our Artistic Director, Buddy James, discusses the audition process.

Singers will be notified of the outcome of their auditions prior to the second rehearsal. Singers who successfully pass their vocal interview will be invited to an information session an hour prior to the second rehearsal.
