Curtain up on a long-awaited return to the spotlight!
Schola’s _Broadway Revival_ brings back a beloved tradition we haven’t staged since the BC years (Before COVID), revived with fresh energy and plenty of showbiz sparkle.

Led by our own Associate Artistic Director and queen of the keys, **Dawn Reyen**, this family-friendly event features non-stop sing-alongs for the Broadway lover and their adoring fans (err — friends and family).
From the hills of _The Sound of Music_ to the barber’s chair in _Sweeney Todd_, from the barricades of _Les Mis_ to the dance halls of _West Side Story_, we’re covering all the iconic moments that make Broadway, well … Broadway.
And yes — _anything goes_: audience requests are welcome, so bring your deepest cuts and boldest dreams.

Whether you’re defying gravity like _Elphaba_, still flying high after seeing _Wicked: For Good_ in the fall, or channeling your inner Tevye with arms outstretched, this is your moment in the spotlight.
Expect ballads, belters, snack breaks, and a _You Can’t Stop the Beat_-style encore that’ll have the whole house on its feet.

So grab your friends, bring the family, warm up those vocal cords, and remember — _don’t throw away your shot!_
