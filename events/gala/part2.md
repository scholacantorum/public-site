Our Renaissance theme for this Gala is inspired by the humanity and genius of
Leonardo da Vinci.  He believed that people who achieve great things do not wait
for opportunities to come to them.  They create their own opportunities,
whatever the challenges they face.  We are blessed to have supporters like you
who continue to help Schola create opportunities for greatness.

The Renaissance, a time of cultural renewal and great achievement, inspires us
to reach out to thank you for helping Schola reach its Diamond Anniversary.  We
invite you to renew your part in Schola’s transformative concerts, where we
share Schola Cantorum’s collective passion for choral music, our driving force
for 60 years.
