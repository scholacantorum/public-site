Schola welcomed singers of all ages and abilities to **First Congregational Church of Palo Alto**
on **Monday, December 16** at **7:30 pm** for its 58th annual _Messiah_ Sing.

We sang the Christmas section of _Messiah_, plus other favorite movements from the work, with orchestra.
We came together in in a jubilant celebration of the season!

Everyone sang, including in the solos!
