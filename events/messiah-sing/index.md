A treasured holiday tradition returns!
Join us for Schola Cantorum’s 59th Annual Messiah Sing —
a joyous community celebration of Handel’s masterpiece.
Whether you know every note or just want to soak in the music from the pews,
all are welcome at this beloved sing-along.

We’ll be joined by the Schola Sinfonia as we fill the sanctuary with soaring choruses and timeless beauty.
And don’t miss the grand finale: the Hallelujah Chorus Reprise, led by this year’s special guest conductor —
longtime Schola singer and gala auction winner, Melanie Ercoli!

Raise your voice, lift your spirits, and help us kick off the season in truly glorious fashion.
