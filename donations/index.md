### Help us spread the Joy of Singing for all in the Silicon Valley by donating to Schola Cantorum

Schola Cantorum is dedicated to providing great music to you and your community
through concerts, kids’ educational programs, free visits to senior centers, and
fun singing afternoons for all.  We also commission new works by local
composers. This keeps choral music alive and growing.

As a nonprofit, we’re dependent upon the generosity of our donors.  And
donations to Schola are tax deductible for most people. So why wait? There are
many ways that you can donate!

**Donate stocks:**  
Donating appreciated stocks and securities to Schola Cantorum can offer you a
tax-efficient alternative way to support Schola Cantorum’s programs.  By making
an appreciated stock donation, **you will escape any capital gains taxes on
those stocks**. In addition, if your tax circumstances permit, you can **deduct
the current market value of the gift** for income tax purposes, just as if you
had made a cash donation. The after-tax cost of making your charitable gift may
be less with a gift of appreciated stocks than with cash.  Call our office for
details at (650) 254–1700.
