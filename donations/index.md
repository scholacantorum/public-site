### Help us spread the Joy of Singing for all in the Silicon Valley by donating to Schola Cantorum

Schola Cantorum is dedicated to providing great music to you and your community
through concerts, kids’ educational programs, free visits to senior centers, and
fun singing afternoons for all.  We also commission new works by local
composers. This keeps choral music alive and growing.

As a nonprofit, we’re dependent upon the generosity of our donors.  And
donations to Schola are tax deductible for most people. So why wait? There are
many ways that you can donate!

**Donate by phone:**  
Call our office at (650) 254–1700. If we aren’t in the office, just leave a
message and a suggested time for us to return your call.

**Send a check,** payable to Schola Cantorum.

<form action="https://www.paypal.com/donate" method="post" target="_top" style="margin-top:-1rem"><input type="hidden" name="hosted_button_id" value="8KCPPTT8JCA26" /><input type="image" src="https://www.paypalobjects.com/en_US/i/btn/btn_donate_LG.gif" border="0" name="submit" title="Donate via PayPal" alt="Donate via PayPal button" /></form>
If you will be using a credit card, we ask you to use the blue “Donate Online” button above rather than PayPal, 
because PayPal’s processing fees are much higher.<p></p>

**Sponsor a concert:**  
*See your name in our program!*  Schola Cantorum has a range of concert
sponsorship opportunities available for corporations, businesses and
individuals.  For concert sponsorship details, call our office at (650)
254–1700.

**Donate stocks:**  
Donating appreciated stocks and securities to Schola Cantorum can offer you a
tax-efficient alternative way to support Schola Cantorum’s programs.  By making
an appreciated stock donation, **you will escape any capital gains taxes on
those stocks**. In addition, if your tax circumstances permit, you can **deduct
the current market value of the gift** for income tax purposes, just as if you
had made a cash donation. The after-tax cost of making your charitable gift may
be less with a gift of appreciated stocks than with cash.  Call our office for
details at (650) 254–1700.

**Make a final gift** with the Schola Cantorum Legacy program:  
Do you want to be remembered for your generosity to the joy of music for all in
Silicon Valley?  Consider using your will to give a final gift to Schola
Cantorum. Donations from the estates of Schola supporters have become an
important gift to Schola’s mission and music. You don’t need to be wealthy to
make a difference for Schola Cantorum. Just call our office at (650) 254‑1700
to set up an appointment to discuss Legacy donations to Schola Cantorum.
