Schola Cantorum’s 62nd season invites you on a journey through music that moves — body, heart, and spirit.
From the infectious rhythms of samba to the driving energy of Appalachian bluegrass,
we celebrate cultures where music pulses with life.
At the heart of the season, _Elijah_ and _Come From the Skies: A High Lonesome Mass_ offer powerful reflections through music shaped by faith, resilience, and revelation.

We round out the year with holiday cheer — from a movie-magic spin on seasonal classics to our beloved _Messiah_ Sing, now in its 59th year.
Whether you’re a longtime listener or a first-time singer, we hope you’ll find connection, curiosity, and community in every note.

Feel the rhythm. Find your revelation. Get tickets now!
