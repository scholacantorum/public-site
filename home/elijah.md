Join us for a towering performance of **Felix Mendelssohn’s _Elijah_** —
an epic oratorio brimming with drama, power, and divine revelation.
With full orchestra, stunning soloists, and nearly a hundred voices strong,
this concert brings to life the prophet’s struggle against doubt, drought, and despair
in one of the most riveting sacred works ever composed.
