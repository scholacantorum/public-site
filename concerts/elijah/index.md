_Thunder crashes. Fire falls. A voice cries out in the wilderness._

Join Schola Cantorum for a towering performance of **Felix Mendelssohn’s _Elijah_** —
an epic oratorio brimming with drama, power, and divine revelation.
With full orchestra, stunning soloists, and nearly a hundred voices strong,
this concert brings to life the prophet’s struggle against doubt, drought, and despair
in one of the most riveting sacred works ever composed.

From whispered prayers to blazing choral climaxes, _Elijah_ is a masterwork of biblical proportions — both intimate and immense, human and holy.
Come experience the storm, the silence, and the triumph.
