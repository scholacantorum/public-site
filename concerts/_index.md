Schola Cantorum&rsquo;s 62<sup>nd</sup> season invites you on a journey through music that moves&mdash;body, heart, and spirit. From the infectious rhythms of samba to the driving energy of Appalachian bluegrass, we celebrate cultures where music pulses with life. At the heart of the season, *Elijah* and *Come From the Skies: A High Lonesome Mass* offer powerful reflections through music shaped by faith, resilience, and revelation.

We round out the year with holiday cheer&mdash;from a movie-magic spin on seasonal classics to our beloved *Messiah* Sing, now in its 59<sup>th</sup> year. Whether you&apos;re a longtime listener or a first-time singer, we hope you&apos;ll find connection, curiosity, and community in every note.

Feel the rhythm. Find your revelation. Get tickets now!
