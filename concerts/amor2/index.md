From playful sambas and infectious maracatus to haunting lullabies and evocative folk melodies,

We’re thrilled to be joined by Brazilian conductor, composer, and arranger Daniel Afonso,
who brings deep cultural insight and creative brilliance to this collaboration.
The program features works by Brazilian composers, choral arrangements of popular favorites, and new perspectives on traditional tunes,
highlighting the diversity of Brazil’s regional sounds and stories.

Whether it’s your first foray into Brazilian music or you’ve loved it all your life, this concert promises an afternoon of joy, discovery, and irresistible rhythm.
