This concert of Psalm settings will take listeners on an emotional journey,
with a message as relevant today as the day the Psalms were written. 

Leonard Bernstein&rsquo;s exquisite choral classic, _Chichester Psalms_, includes organ, harp, percussion, and boy soprano.
Bernstein described the music as &ldquo;forthright, songful, rhythmic and youthful.&rdquo;

The ten Psalms in Shawn Kirchner&rsquo;s melodious and inspiring _Songs of Ascent_, presented here in the premier performance of its organ and harp arrangement, take us &ldquo;from estrangement to reconcilation, dispersal to reunion, and anticipation to culmination.&rdquo;

Both works conclude with text from Psalm 133,
&ldquo;Behold, how good and how pleasant it is for brethren to dwell together in unity.&rdquo;
