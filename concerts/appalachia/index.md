A journey through the musical landscapes of Earth’s oldest mountain range.

With haunting harmonies, aching beauty, and fierce spiritual depth,
**Echoes of Appalachia** invites you into the heart of a region whose music is as layered and resilient as its history.

At the center of the program is Sharp & Ramsay’s _Come From the Skies: A High Lonesome Mass_, a powerful fusion of sacred tradition and Appalachian folk.
Framed by timeless favorites like _Shenandoah_, _Down in the River to Pray_, and _Bright Morning Stars_,
the concert explores the tension and tenderness of a people shaped by hardship, hope, and unwavering faith.

Through sorrow and strength, silence and song, this is a tribute to the voices that echo across mountaintops — clear, unflinching, and unforgettable.
