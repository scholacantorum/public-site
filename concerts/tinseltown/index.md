This holiday season, take a trip down memory lane — Hollywood style!
_Tinseltown: The Holidays in Hollywood_ is our joyful, cinematic spin on Schola Cantorum’s beloved annual holiday concert.
Instead of sleigh bells and snowflakes alone, we’re celebrating the holiday magic of the silver screen.

From timeless movie melodies to heartwarming tunes that spark seasonal nostalgia (even if they’re not technically holiday songs),
this program promises cozy memories, feel-good favorites, and plenty of opportunities to sing along.
Bring the whole family, come dressed as your favorite Hollywood holiday character, and keep your eyes peeled — there might just be a special visitor in the audience.

Plus: Bring your gently used winter coats for **One Warm Coat** to help keep our neighbors warm this winter.
